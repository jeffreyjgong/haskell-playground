# haskell-playground

Had to use CC=/opt/homebrew/bin/g++ on Mac OSX as ghc complains when clang (Mac's default compiler) is used to link c++ standard libraries.

Mostly followed this tutorial
- [Learn you a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters)
- Mostly done by using `ghci` and loading and reloading files as needed
